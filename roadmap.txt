To setup, you will need to install each of the dependencies.

Obviously you will need git, I will leave it you to you to install that for the time being.

You will need administrative privileges to install this, so use a development machine.

#git python will need to be installed by IST

Alternatively, might be able to run the whole thing in jython (jgit lib clone support???)


#use jgit, jython, onejar.
->clone (wget)
->checkout branch at stable tag
->actions:

->action ->synonyms
->create -> add, +, 
	-> branches, commits, tags
->destroy-> del, [-f, -rf] (revwalk, prune, garbage collect)

->meld [branches]
